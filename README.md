# Absozero's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, managed with chezmoi. They are meant to be usable across
both linux and windows, and should be relatively pragmatic, rather than to
provide the greatest feature amount. This ideology forces the configs to use
internal tooling as much as possible.

## Contributions

If you see any improvements to be made with the dotfiles, please open an issue
or pull request and I shall take a look at it.
